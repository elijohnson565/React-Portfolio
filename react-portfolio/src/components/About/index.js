            <p>My name is Elijah Johnson and I am a 23 year old aspiring full stack web developer. 
                Ive had a passion for coding since I was 16 and have been mostly self taught. I started learning as much as I could over a couple years from youtube and forums, and then began making video games. I finished and released two before I 
                realized that it wasn't a realistic career option for me at the time. Instead my attention focused on web development. 
                I stopped making video games and signed up for a 6 month full stack web development course through UC Davis. 
                I am working on completing the bootcamp now and have already created some websites that I want to share. Below is a collection of the projects that I have finished. There will be many more to come!</p>
